# 🚀 Delivery App with Java Spring 🌌
Greetings, intergalactic explorer 👽! This repository is all about our whimsical delivery application. The app is crafted for educational purpose and aims to beam an interesting learning experience straight into our curious minds.

## 🛠️ Technologies
Our app will be crafted using the mystical powers of **<span style="color:#32ba56">Java Spring</span>**, a robust and widely-adored framework for conjuring enterprise-level applications. Choosing Java Spring ensures scalability, maintainability, and a rock-solid foundation for our cosmic application. In addition to Java Spring, we harness the enchanting capabilities of **<span style="color:#b3a652">Hibernate ORM</span>** (Object-Relational Mapping) and **<span style="color:#ba437d">Java Persistence API</span>** (JPA) to seamlessly interact with databases, providing a magical layer of abstraction for our data management needs. This powerful combination ensures that our educational app not only delivers a stellar user experience but also maintains a strong and flexible connection with its underlying data sources.

## 👾 Team Collaboration
Our quirky tribe, featuring [Olga Moumtzi](https://github.com/OlgaLom), [Stefania Douliaka](https://github.com/estefaniadlk), [Aimilia Gogolou](https://github.com/aimigogo), and [Anastasia Bampasi](https://github.com/AnastasiaBam), will be merrily collaborating using agile development methodologies. Picture regular meetings where ideas sparkle like shooting stars, communication that flows smoother than stardust, and a shared project management platform ["Trello"](https://trello.com)  acts as our cosmic mission control for the success of our celestial project.

Special thanks to our wise leaders, Dionysis Petrotos and Constantinos Giannacoulis from [Code.hub](https://codehub.gr/), who guide us through the galaxies of knowledge! 🌠🙌

Let's embark on this interstellar journey together! 🚀✨
